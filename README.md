> :warning: v2 is not ready for production use yet! You might be actually finding for the v1 version right now: https://github.com/poi-vrc/DressingTools/tree/1.x :warning:

## Difference with v1
Concept in applying the clothes have been changed. Instead of calling "clothes" are clothes, they are called "wearables" in v2.
Wearables do not necessarily contain an Armature, and theoretically any items can be attached to the avatar in v2.
 
Bone mappings are first generated by an entity called a Dresser, and they will be applied by another entity called an Applier at the later stage.

To assemble a wearable into an avatar, a wearable configuration is required, which contains all the required toggles and various items when processing with an integration. It is not code-bonded and can be shared to your friends or the Internet without the tool and the original prefabs. The wearable configuration is expected to be automatically drafted by the tool in the development.

More details will be disclosed in the online documentation in the future.
